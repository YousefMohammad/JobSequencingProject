# *JobSequenceProject*
------------------------
#### *This Project focuses on the optimal arrangement of jobs that certain deadlines must be completed to maximize profit or minimize loss.*

## Problem Definition:
------------------------
You have a set of jobs, each with a deadline and a profit (or cost) associated with completing it within its deadline.
The objective is to find the sequence of jobs that maximizes total profit or minimizes total cost.

## Constraints:
----------------
Each job takes a unit of time to complete.
One job can be scheduled at a time.
Jobs have specific deadlines and associated profits or penalties.

## Approach:
--------------
**Greedy Algorithm**: One of the most common approaches is using a greedy algorithm, where jobs are prioritized based on their profit or deadline. 
                         The algorithm selects the job that offers the most benefit (highest profit or lowest penalty) first.
                         
**Sorting**: Jobs are often sorted based on their profit or deadline as part of the algorithm.

**Feasibility Check**: After sorting, each job is checked for feasibility, i.e., whether it can be completed within its deadline.<br/>

## Complexity:
---------------
The computational complexity of the problem can vary depending on the approach used. The greedy method often provides an efficient solution but doesn't always guarantee the optimal sequence.

## Applications:
-----------------
This problem is relevant in various scenarios like manufacturing, scheduling in computer systems, and project management, where tasks need to be completed optimally to achieve maximum efficiency or profit.
